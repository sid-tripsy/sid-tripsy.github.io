								<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/pictest.jpg" alt="" /></span>I pursued my undergraduate program in Electronics and Communication Engineering at R.V College of Engineering, Bengaluru from August 2012 to May 2016. Opportunities flooded with every coming year, and I got a chance to work on a project which combined IoT with Machine Learning algorithms and was titled as ‘Sewerage Monitoring with Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning’. Having submitted the research to the International Research Journal of Engineering and Technology (IRJET) for review, we got it published in the IRJET Journal in May 2019. During fourth year, I worked on another project titled ‘Cloud Based Intelligent Traffic System’, which, after rounds of review, was published in 3rd International Conference on Trends in Electronics and Informatics (ICOEI), sponsored by IEEE. During the four years of undergrad studies, I learned software programming skills by taking electives like OOPS with C++ and Data Structures. These skills helped me during the campus placement and I was able to secure a job at one of the largest American Bank, Wells Fargo. </p>

<p>I joined Wells Fargo as a Technology Analyst and worked under the Consumer Lending Technology department as a part of the Home Equity Business Intelligence Team. My team was responsible for driving ‘Technology Health Refresh (THR)’ activity which involved upgrading platform architecture for the online banking application, wherein I contributed by developing, optimizing and maintaining data architectures. My work further included designing and developing frameworks in SQL and Python for testing integrity of application data.</p>

<p>In Sep 2017, I joined Rankethon, an education-tech (edTech) and online tutoring firm, as an Associate. I was responsible for planning, forecasting and developing deep business insight for the third-party syndication and distribution network of the educational institutions throughout the country. I designed, developed and established KPIs to monitor analysis and provide strategic insights to drive performance in all delivery measures including Marketing and Customer Service metrics using Tableau and SAS. I got an opportunity to expand my knowledge to implement Machine Learning & Deep Learning algorithms using Python and R in solving complex analytics problems. My enthusiasm, coupled with the scope for innovations and opportunities available in the field of Data Analytics, has kept me motivated to contribute to the industry.</p>

<p>Presently, I am a graduate student at Texas A&M University MS-MIS program. My expected date of graduation is May 2022. I am learning how to efficiently manage complex systems belonging to different industry sectors. With my focus on Data Analytics and Business Intelligence, I am continuously enhancing my skills in this domain through courses and projects taught by some of the best professors utilizing the most innovative teaching methods. Texas A&M University ranks among the top Public universities in the US. I feel great to be learning with the smartest people from all around the world. On receiving my graduate degree, I see myself as an all-together different person with much better understanding of business and people.</p>

<p>I am a focused problem solver, constantly trying to streamline processes and generate efficiency. I have experience in volunteering and team leadership positions which have made me a better team player and instilled in me the confidence to step forward and take the lead when the situation demands.</p>

<p>Keen to employ novel methodologies to produce innovative solutions, I like to keep myself abreast of latest industry and market trends. I am fond of post-rock music and formula-one racing and I am proficient in English, Hindi.</p>
